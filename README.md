## Numerical Algorithms

A repository for a task done on the Numerical Algorithms subject while studying at the University of Gda≈Ñsk.

## Zadanie 1

Program calculating the set value of the function cos(x)\*arctg(x) in 4 ways:

1. By summing up the elements of the power series calculated directly from Taylor's formula w
   sequence from the beginning,
2. By summing up the elements of the power series calculated directly from Taylor's formula w
   sequence from the end,
3. Summing up the elements of the power series from the beginning but calculating the next term
   row based on the previous one,
4. Summing up the elements of the power series from the end but calculating the next term of the series on the basis of
   the previous one.

## Zadanie 2

A program that allows you to add and multiply matrices. The program also allows you to solve matrices by Gaussian
elimination in three ways:

- G: without selecting the base element,
- PG: with partial selection of the base element,
- FG: with complete selection of the base element.

All operations are performed on three types:

- TF: Single Precision Type (Float)
- TD: Double Precision Type (Double)
- TC: custom type that stores a number as a fraction of an integer (numerator and denominator notated with BigInteger)
